# The Dynamis Chatbot
This repository holds a chatbot written in Java for an in-depth introductory
programming course. It speaks to certain philosophical terms or people
and has an adaptive conversation system (called ConversationMode) that
relies on what the user inputs to create dialogue. It is based on
an exercise in a book authored by Michael KÃ¶lling and David J.
Barnes--their *Objects First with Java: A Practical Introduction
Using BlueJ* (6th ed.) text.

Compared to other projects I have created, it is not as refined.
However, as an early programming project, this makes some sense.
I may return to it in the future and greatly improve upon it
with a stronger understanding of data structures and 
the statistical and learning algorithms that compose 
chatbots in the present day.
