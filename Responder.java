 * This class is meant to process the input material gotten through the Chatter class and

 * "Conversation Mode", which allows the AI to connect certain topics to one another and ever 
 * so slightly learn about relationships between different terms. As DYNAMIS is a 
 * philosophy-oriented AI, the preprogrammed responses have to do with philosophy; the 
 * Conversation Mode and default responses allow the AI to communicate somewhat in other 
 * topics. Lastly, it gets and keeps track of the user's name, putting it in responses 
 * variably to increase repetition and move toward more natural language.

     * This function enacts Conversation Mode. Conversation mode tweaks its responses on a
     * wider range of user input, trying to act as if listening to what the user says
     * and responding contextually. It also builds a memory that can allow it to link up
     * topics and continue discussions of other topics in relation to one another. It acts
     * distinctly from the other modes of conversation and only drops back into the default
     * modes when the user gives an input it cannot work with (i.e. the recommended blank
     * input to end Conversation Mode).
     * 
     * @param The String that was the original user's input and the randomized Integer that
     * states whether or not the user's name will be used in the final output.
